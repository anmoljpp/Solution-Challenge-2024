# Solution-Challenge-2024

first import mindwave.py file in MusicMindCode.py. 
check at which port the Mindwave mobile is listening(on my system it was PORT-5)
then define port in MusicMIndCode and you are good to go. 
when the Concentration Level is Good it will play madirfan-both-of-us-14037.mp3 (also download this file in your system too)

**TO run this project you need this device called a Neuralink Mindwave Mobile**__
